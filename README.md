# assembly-syscall-benchmark
Syscall vs Int 0x80 Benchmark Tool
This tool compares the execution times of two assembly programs, one using the int 0x80 system call and the other using syscall. It automates the process of assembling, linking, and benchmarking both programs, then outputs the average execution time and the performance difference.

Features
Assembles and links user-provided assembly files.
Runs both programs multiple times and calculates average execution times.
Displays the percentage difference in performance between int 0x80 and syscall.
Prerequisites
update your linux
to update run this command:

sudo apt update
NASM (Netwide Assembler) installed.
You can install it using:

sudo apt install nasm
figlet (for terminal banner, optional).
You can install it using:

sudo apt install figlet
How to Use
Clone this repository:
https://github.com/MadihaSehar/assembly-syscall-benchmark.git
Navigate into the directory:

cd assembly-syscall-benchmark/
Make the script executable:

chmod +x runner.sh
Run the tool by providing your assembly files:

./runner.sh
Follow the prompts to enter the filenames of your two assembly programs:

The first file should use int 0x80.
The second file should use syscall.
For example:

Enter the filename for program1 (int 0x80, e.g., program1.asm): my_int80_program.asm
Enter the filename for program2 (syscall, e.g., program2.asm): my_syscall_program.asm
Example Commands
For testing two files, e.g., int80_test.asm and syscall_test.asm, you can do the following:

Place the files in the same directory as the script.
Run the script:
./runner.sh
Output
The script will display the average execution times for both programs and show which method is faster, as well as by what percentage.
